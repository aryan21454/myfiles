Firstly i create the three threads and A,B,C and by using sched_setparam funtion i set the scheduling policies and i have use the
SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_RR SCHED_FIFO
and then i evaluate the time period of the fucntions 
which contains loop from 1 to 2**32 and call them by each thread and by default priorites and by the chaging the prirorities
and use this upto three times for each one thread
and calculate the each time of exceution and time of termination and 
i have make the graph with the time taken vs the priorities for the SCHED_OTHER,SCHED_RR,SCHED_FIFO
